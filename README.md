Easy WordPress comparisons and SEO friendly.

This snippet do the following:
1. It takes new post title
2. It cycle through all posts until it creates all "new post vs existing posts" posts.

If any of the single item posts is deleted it deletes appropriate comparison posts.

Once you have this and your items are eg custom post types containing Advanced Custom Fields values you can now easily create template for comparisons.

Advantage of this is that these comparison pages are part of the Wordpress article system. No custom and adittional SEO is needed (YOAST works out of the box), comparison posts are editable with adittional content.
