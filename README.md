Easy WordPress comparisons which are SEO friendly.

This snippet (WordPress function) does the following:
1. It takes a new post title
2. It cycles through all posts until it creates all "new posts vs existing posts" posts.

If any of the single-item posts is deleted it deletes appropriate comparison posts.

Once you have this (added to function.php) and your items are eg custom post types containing Advanced Custom Fields values you can now easily create a template for comparisons. You need to modify your category ID.

The advantage of this is that these comparison pages are part of the WordPress article system. No custom and additional SEO is needed (YOAST works out of the box), and comparison posts are editable with additional content.
